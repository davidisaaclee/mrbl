TODO
[X] change all layers to groups
  - apparently, the only added value for layers is the ability to have an active
    layer, which is unwanted for our graphics system

[no] make auto-positioning group subclass
  - use as a placeholder for swappable graphics items; set constraints for the
    positioning of the group's children, and automatically reposition when a new
    child is added
  - on second thought, just using groups should work fine for this...

[X] separate inspector and make abstract baseclass
  - it would be nice to easily make different inspectors for different synths
  - baseclass: make it easy to map an inspector to a model

[ ] fix `didViewportTransform` action
  - moving camera control to the layer instead of the project complicates things.
  - test the new camera control (behavior of adding children after transforming layer)
    - turns out that transforming a "world" layer doesn't affect any children
      added after the transform. i see two solutions:
      - keep this method of transform, and subclass `Layer` to apply its
        transform on any new children
      - maintain another Paper stage for non-world elements
  - add viewport bounds to action
